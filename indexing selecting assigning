iloc uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. loc, meanwhile, indexes inclusively.

This is particularly confusing when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. 0,...,1000. In this case df.iloc[0:1000] will return 1000 entries, while df.loc[0:1000] return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using loc, you will need to go one lower and ask for df.iloc[0:999].
